I recently worked on an exciting project that involved training a Machine Learning model and building a Flask-based web application to classify words based on sentiment (positive or negative). ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights of the Project:

âœ… Trained a Machine Learning model for text classification

âœ… Developed a Flask web app for real-time sentiment analysis

âœ… Used WordCloud to visualize word frequency patterns

âœ… Classified words into positive and negative categories

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in ML model training, Flask development, and data visualization.
